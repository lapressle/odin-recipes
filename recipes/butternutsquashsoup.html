    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large butternut squash</li>
            <li>1/2 stick of butter plus an additional 1/2 stick</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Ras al Hanout</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds.</li>
            <li> Place the squash on a roasting pan skin side down and divide the 1/2 stick of butter four ways.</li>
            <li>Put a piece of butter in each hole where the seeds were. Add the cranberries to the pan for the last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of brown sugar over each half of squash and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast the squash in a 350Â°F oven until soft and slightly browned, about 45 minutes. Allow the squash to cool.</li>
            <li>In a large sauce pan, melt the remaining 1/2 stick of butter over medium heat and cook the onion until soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Using a large spoon, scoop the flesh of the squash away from the skin and add it to the pot. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil with the Ras al Hanout.</li>
            <li>Simmer the soup for 20 minutes. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Stir in the cream and serve.</li>
        </ol>
